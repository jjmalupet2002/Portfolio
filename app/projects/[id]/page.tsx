    longDescription:
      "This project is a production-style MERN Ticketing System designed to simulate a real-world support and issue-tracking platform. It allows users to create and manage tickets while agents handle assignment, communication, and resolution through a structured workflow. The application is built with TypeScript, containerized using Docker, and deployed via GitLab CI/CD to AWS EC2, following DevOps best practices such as immutable production containers, environment-based configuration, and automated deployments. The goal of the project is not only functional correctness, but also to demonstrate end-to-end system design, deployment, and operational readiness.\n\nThe system implements role-based access control to ensure secure interactions between users, agents, and administrators. Users can easily create tickets with attachments, track their progress, and engage in threaded conversations with assigned agents. Agents are provided with a specialized control center to claim unassigned tickets, manage their active workload, and access internal resources like SOPs and tech manuals.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the backend is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, utilizing MongoDB for data storage with indexed queries for performance. The frontend is a responsive React application using Redux Toolkit for state management and TypeScript for type safety. The infrastructure is fully automated, with a GitLab CI/CD pipeline handling the build, test, and deployment phases, ensuring that any changes are reliably pushed to the AWS EC2 production environment.",

Designed with a focus on modern web standards and user experience, this project demonstrates real-time data integration and interactive state management.",
    longDescription:
      "SpaceX Launch Explorer is a sophisticated web application built with Nuxt 3 and Vue 3 that provides real-time access to SpaceX mission data through the public GraphQL API. The application showcases advanced frontend architecture patterns including server-side rendering, hybrid rendering optimization, and sophisticated state management using Pinia.\n\nThe immersive UI is built with Vuetify 3, providing a sleek material design interface with custom theming and responsive layouts that adapt fluidly across devices. Users can explore comprehensive mission details, compare rocket specifications, filter launches by year or mission name, and bookmark their favorite missions.\n\nThe architecture emphasizes performance optimization through Vite's rapid bundling and Nuxt 3's hybrid rendering capabilities, ensuring sub-second interaction latency and high frame rates during scroll and animation events. The Apollo Client GraphQL integration enables efficient data fetching with built-in caching, while Pinia stores manage complex application state with fine-grained reactivity.\n\nThe project demonstrates best practices in modern Vue 3 development including composables for logic reuse, TypeScript for type safety, and comprehensive error handling for graceful degradation when API calls fail.",
